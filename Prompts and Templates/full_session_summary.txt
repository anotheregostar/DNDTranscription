Please fill out this template below for the attached session transcript, following the markdown format strictly. If a player doesn't have spoken lines in the transcript assume that they missed the session and note that they were missing in the Player and NPC interactions section, but still include any interactions or actions described by the DM or another player. Similarly when creating the short player summary for section 4, note that the player was absent and include a brief summary of actions described by the DM or other players.
